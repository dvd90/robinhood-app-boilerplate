# CLAUDE.md

Conventions for AI agents (Claude Code, Cursor, Codex) working in this repo and in
any project scaffolded from it. Read this before writing code. Keep changes small,
test-first, and green.

## What this is

A Chassis-style boilerplate for on-chain projects on **Robinhood Chain (chain ID 4663)**.
Core primitives:

- **MembershipNFT** — ERC-721; each token mints an ERC-6551 token-bound account (TBA).
- **RevenueVault** — pro-rata distribution of *explicitly deposited* revenue to current holders.
- **Factory** — EIP-1167 `cloneDeterministic` of NFT + Vault, wired and ownership-transferred in one tx.
- **IWeightStrategy** — pluggable holder-weight function (levels, tenure, whatever). Game logic lives here, never in the vault.

Optional layers behind CLI flags: `apps/web` (Next 15 + wagmi/viem), a plain `GameToken` ERC-20.

## Golden rules (architectural invariants — do not violate)

1. **The vault distributes only what is explicitly deposited via `depositRevenue()`.**
   Mint proceeds go to the creator/treasury and are **never** routed into the vault.
   This is the load-bearing design decision. Do not add a code path that forwards mint
   fees, sell taxes, or any auto-tax into `RevenueVault`. If a task seems to ask for it,
   stop and flag it — it changes the economic model from "revenue share" to
   "recycled deposits" and breaks the invariant the tests enforce.
2. **Game mechanics never touch money math.** Weight comes from `IWeightStrategy` via
   interface only. The vault must compile and pass its tests against a mock strategy with
   zero knowledge of levels/feeding/etc.
3. **Do not ship market-making, multi-wallet, or volume-simulation tooling.** Not in
   contracts, scripts, or frontend. Out of scope, permanently.
4. **Never hardcode an unverified address.** All chain constants live in one place
   (`contracts/src/Constants.sol` + `apps/web/lib/robinhood.ts`) and every external
   address (6551 registry, account impl, stock tokens, Uniswap) must be marked
   `// VERIFY: <source>` until confirmed against official Robinhood Chain docs and the
   block explorer. A wrong address is a silent-failure bug.
5. **Trustlessness over convenience.** Clones are non-upgradeable. Owner powers are
   minimized and `Ownable2Step`. No function lets an owner pull tokens out of user TBAs
   or out of undistributed vault balances.

## Repo layout

    Constants.sol            # chain 4663 constants, all VERIFY-tagged
    strategies/
      IWeightStrategy.sol
      EqualWeightStrategy.sol # default: every holder equal
    GameToken.sol            # optional, plain ERC-20, NO transfer tax

  lib/robinhood.ts
deployments/4663.json        # written by deploy, read by frontend
```

## Commands (the gate)

Every commit and every CI run must pass, in this order:

```bash
forge fmt --check
forge test                   # unit + fuzz + invariant
pnpm -C apps/web tsc --noEmit   # if apps/web present
pnpm -C apps/web lint           # if apps/web present
```

`pnpm verify` runs all of the above. Do not commit red. Do not `--skip` or comment out a
failing test to "get to green" — fix the code or fix the test with a stated reason.

## TDD workflow (required)

1. Write or extend the failing test(s) first. Run `forge test`, confirm red.
2. Write the minimum implementation to pass. Confirm green.
3. Add fuzz/invariant runs for anything touching arithmetic or ownership before moving on.
4. `forge fmt`, then run the full gate.

Two invariants must be green before any integration work:
- **Vault conservation** — Σ distributed == deposited − carried dust; nothing minted or lost.
- **TBA control follows the NFT** — the TBA address is fixed per tokenId; its owner
  resolves through `ownerOf(tokenId)`, so after transfer the new holder controls it.

## Solidity conventions

- Solidity ^0.8.24, `forge fmt` defaults, OpenZeppelin for ERC-721/Ownable2Step/Clones/ReentrancyGuard.
- Clones use `initialize()` guarded by an initializer; constructors only on implementations
  (which are then disabled for the impl via `_disableInitializers()`).
- Checks-effects-interactions; `nonReentrant` on `distribute()`. Assume reward tokens are
  hostile ERC-20s and test with a re-entering mock.
- Integer-division remainder ("dust") is carried forward in the vault, never dropped.
- Emit rich events for every state change (mint, deposit, distribute, clone) — the frontend
  and any indexer read these, not storage.
- Custom errors, not revert strings.

## Frontend conventions (if present)

- wagmi + viem, chain pinned to 4663 from `lib/robinhood.ts`. No other chains.
- Read TBA balances by computing the 6551 account address and calling `balanceOf` on each
  reward token; value via the official price feed. Never trust a hardcoded balance.
- All addresses imported from `lib/robinhood.ts`. No inline address literals in components.

## Out of scope (do not build)

- Any auto-tax/fee path into the vault (see rule 1).
- Wallet-farming, wash-trading, or price-manipulation tooling (rule 3).
- Upgradeable clones, owner escape hatches over user funds (rule 5).

## Note on chain constants

Chain 4663 / registry / stock-token addresses in this repo originate from project notes and
are **not yet verified**. Before any real deploy, confirm every constant against official
Robinhood Chain documentation and the block explorer, and drop the `VERIFY` tags only once
confirmed.
